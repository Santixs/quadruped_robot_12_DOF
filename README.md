How to Run the Files
Step 1: Run the Robot Program
Open a terminal.

Navigate to the robot's program directory and execute the control script:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd quadruped_robot_12_DOF/triceratops_quadruped_robot/triceratops_base/
python3 Controller.py
Step 2: Control the Robot
You can control the robot using a joystick.

Joystick Controller
Open another terminal.

Run the joystick controller script:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd champ/src/champ_teleop/
python3 Joy_controller.py
Open another terminal.

Start the joy_node topic:

bash
Copy
Edit
ros2 run joy joy_node
System Architecture and Workflow


The main program, Controller.py, runs in a loop and controls the quadruped robotâ€™s movements through the Joystick Interface, Controller, and Hardware Interface.

1. Joystick Interface
Receives joystick signals via Bluetooth and outputs the current state through ROS2 topics.
Controls the robotâ€™s forward, backward, left, and right movements.
2. Controller
Gait Generator: Generates the robotâ€™s gait trajectory. Currently supports Trot gait.
Inverse Kinematics: Computes joint angles corresponding to the gait trajectory and calculates motor output angles using a linkage model.
3. Hardware Interface
Uses Dynamixel Motors to transmit calculated angles to the motors, enabling the robot to walk.
Gait Control
The gait control system consists of four core modules:

1. Gait Scheduler
Determines the state of each leg (stance or swing phase).
In Trot gait, diagonal legs move synchronously and alternate between stance and swing phases.
2. Stance Phase Controller
Controls the legs in contact with the ground, adjusting movement based on the robotâ€™s target velocity.
Ensures support legs move in the opposite direction of the robotâ€™s forward motion.
Adjusts support leg rotation for stable turning.
3. Swing Phase Controller
Lifts the legs that just completed the stance phase and moves them to the next landing position.
Selects landing positions based on the equal displacement principle between swing and stance phases, ensuring stable gait motion.
4. Inverse Kinematics Model
Calculates the target position of legs in Cartesian coordinates and converts them into corresponding joint angles.
These motor angles are sent to the robotâ€™s state variables to drive movement.
Motor Control

Future Prospects
âœ… Integrating IMU to improve the robotâ€™s balance.
âœ… Adding posture variations and more gait patterns.
âœ… Optimizing gait tracking using alternative control methods.
âœ… Enhancing perception capabilities for better environmental adaptability.
